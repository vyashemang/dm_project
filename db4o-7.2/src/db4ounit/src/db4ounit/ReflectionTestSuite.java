/**
 * Support for hierarchically chained test suites.
 * 
 * In the topmost test package define an AllTests class which extends
 * ReflectionTestSuite and returns all subpackage.AllTests classes as
 * testCases. Example:
 * 
 * package org.acme.tests;
 * 
 * public class AllTests extends ReflectionTestSuite {
 * 	protected Class[] testCases() {
 * 		return new Class[] {
 *			org.acme.tests.subsystem1.AllTests.class,
 *			org.acme.tests.subsystem2.AllTests.class,
 *		};
 *	} 			
 * }
