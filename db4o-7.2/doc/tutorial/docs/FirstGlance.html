<body><div id="pagecontainer"><table><tr><td width="5">&nbsp;</td><td><a name="outline2"></a><br><h1>1. First Glance</h1>Before diving straight into the first source code samples&nbsp;let's get you familiar with some basics.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<a name="outline3"></a><br><h2>1.1. The db4o engine</h2>The db4o object database engine consists of one single jar file.&nbsp;This is all that you need to program against. The versions&nbsp;supplied with the distribution can be found in /db4o-7.2/lib/. You&nbsp;will only need one of the following libraries, not all of them.<br>
<br>
<b>db4o-7.2-java1.1.jar</b><br>
will run with most Java JDKs that supply JDK 1.1.x functionality&nbsp;such as reflection and Exception handling. That includes many&nbsp;IBM J9 configurations, Symbian and Savaje.<br>
<br>
<b>db4o-7.2-java1.2.jar</b><br>
is built for all Java JDKs between 1.2 and 1.4.<br>
<br>
<b>db4o-7.2-java5.jar</b><br>
is built for Java JDK 5 and JDK 6<br>
<br>
<a name="outline4"></a><br><h2>1.2. Installation</h2>If you add one of the above db4o-*.jar files to your CLASSPATH&nbsp;db4o is installed. In case you work with an integrated development&nbsp;environment like <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="_blank">Eclipse</a>&nbsp;you would&nbsp;copy the db4o-*.jar to the /lib/&nbsp;folder under your project and add db4o to your project as a library.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="outline5"></a><br><h2>1.3. API Overview</h2>Do not forget the API documentation while reading through this&nbsp;tutorial. It provides an organized view of the API, looking from a&nbsp;java package perspective and you may find related functionality to&nbsp;the theme you are currently reading up on.<br>
<br>
For starters, the java packages com.db4o and com.db4o.query are all&nbsp;that you need to worry about.<br>
<br>
<b>com.db4o</b><br>
<br>
The com.db4o java package contains almost all of the functionality&nbsp;you will commonly need when using db4o. Two objects of note are&nbsp;com.db4o.Db4o, and the com.db4o.ObjectContainer interface.<br>
<br>
The com.db4o.Db4o factory is your starting point. Static methods in&nbsp;this class&nbsp;allow you to open a database file, start a server, or connect to an existing server.&nbsp;It also lets you configure the db4o environment before opening a database.<br>
<br>
The most important interface, and the one that you will be using 99% of the time is <br>
com.db4o.ObjectContainer: This is your db4o database.<br>
- An ObjectContainer can either be a database in single-user mode or&nbsp;a client connection to a db4o server.<br>
- Every ObjectContainer owns one transaction. All work is transactional.&nbsp;When you open an ObjectContainer, you are in a transaction, when you&nbsp;commit() or rollback(), the next transaction is started immediately.<br>
- Every ObjectContainer maintains it's own references to stored and&nbsp;instantiated objects. In doing so, it manages object identities, and&nbsp;is able to achieve a high level of performance.<br>
- ObjectContainers are intended to be kept open as long as you work&nbsp;against them. When you close an ObjectContainer, all database references&nbsp;to objects in RAM will be discarded.<br>
<br>
<b>com.db4o.ext</b><br>
<br>
In case you wonder why you only see very few methods in an ObjectContainer,&nbsp;here is why: The db4o interface is supplied in two steps in two java&nbsp;packages, com.db4o and com.db4o.ext&nbsp;for the following reasons:<br>
- It's easier to get started, because the important methods are emphasized.<br>
- It will be easier for other products to copy the basic db4o interface.<br>
- It is an example of how a lightweight version of db4o could look.<br>
<br>
Every com.db4o.ObjectContainer object is also an com.db4o.ext.ExtObjectContainer.&nbsp;You can cast it to ExtObjectContainer or you can use the&nbsp;method &nbsp;to get to&nbsp;the advanced features.<br>
<br>
<b>com.db4o.config</b><br>
<br>
The com.db4o.config java package&nbsp;contains types and classes necessary to configure db4o. The objects and interfaces&nbsp;within are discussed in the <a href="Configuration.html#Configuration">Configuration</a>&nbsp;section.<br>
<br>
<b>com.db4o.query</b><br>
<br>
The com.db4o.query java package contains&nbsp;the Predicate class to construct <a href="Query.html#Query">Native Queries</a>. The Native Query&nbsp;interface is the primary db4o querying interface and should be preferred over&nbsp;the Soda Query API. <br>
