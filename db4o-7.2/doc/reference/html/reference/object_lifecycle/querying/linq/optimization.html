        <h1>Optimization</h1><p>Those of you who are familiar with db4o query processor may
already suspect that LINQ queries as well as NQ and QueryByExample queries are
converted to <a href="../soda_query.html" class="wikiLink">SODA Query</a> under the hood. And that is true. The downside of this is
that some of the queries cannot be converted to SODA and will run against all
instances of matching class objects. Some of the cases when conversion is not possible: </p>

<ul><li>there is no SODA alternative available</li><li>constraints on aggregates (avg(List) = constant)</li><li>constraints to values that are not available before
query executions (Pilot.Points = Pilot.Name.Length</li></ul>
