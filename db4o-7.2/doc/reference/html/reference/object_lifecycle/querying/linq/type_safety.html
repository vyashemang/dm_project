        <h1>Type Safety</h1><p><br></p><p>In the previous example we used generic types for our query,
constraining on only one type of objects. However LINQ is flexible enough to
allow querying across types:</p>





<p>We have both Car and Pilot objects that can correspond the
selected criteria and - yes, we will get a mixed list of both. This feature is
potentially dangerous as in the development cycle you may lose control of the
objects that answer the criteria and get unexpected results. Be aware and use
untyped LINQ queries with caution.</p>
