        <h1>Drawbacks</h1>

<p>While evaluations offer you another degree of freedom for assembling queries, they come at a certain cost: As you may already have noticed from the example, evaluations work on the fully instantiated objects, while 'normal' queries peek into the database file directly. So there's a certain performance penaltyfor the object instantiation, which is wasted if the object is not included into the candidate set.</p>
<p>Another restriction is that, while 'normal' queries can bypass encapsulation and access candidates' private members directly, evaluations are bound to use their external API, just as in the language itself.</p>
<span name="cs_wiki_filter" csw_filters="java">
<p>One last hint for Java users: Evaluations are expected to be serializable for client/server operation. So be careful when implementing them as (anonymous) inner classes and keep in mind that those will carry an implicit reference to their surrounding class and everything that belongs to it. Best practice is to always implement evaluations as normal top level or static inner classes.</p>
