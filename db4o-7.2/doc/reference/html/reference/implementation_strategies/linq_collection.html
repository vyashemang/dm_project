db4o, which you can use to find different ways to construct your queries. The
information below covers most of the database querying operations and should be
enough for the majority of cases. However, it is still advisable to study <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb308959.aspx">MSDN</a>
resources, which explain in detail how LINQ and Extension methods work. For the
introduction to LINQ queries for db4o please refer to <a href="../object_lifecycle/querying/linq.html" class="wikiLink">LINQ</a>
chapter.</p><a name="Simple Select"></a><h2>Simple Select</h2>

<p>Let's fill up the database with some data:</p>





<p>In order to select objects of only Pilot class we can issue
the following query:</p>





<p>Note, that where clause is optional: if it is not specified
all objects of Pilot class will be returned.</p>

<p>We can make querying even easier by using anonymous types:</p>



<a name="Database Object Clone"></a><h2>Database Object Clone</h2>

<p>You can easily use LINQ to create database objects clones:</p>





<p>Retrieved objects are not bound to the object container, but
they duplicate the values from the database. You can use them for an
"object-readonly" mode.</p><a name="Select Any Type"></a><h2>Select Any Type</h2>

<p>With the selection we are not bound to only one type of
objects - actually we can select everything that is currently in the database:</p>





<p>We can further use this broad selection too. As the query
result implements IQueryable interface, we can re-use it to retrieve more
specific objects:</p>





<p>In this example we use an all objects selection to find a
range of pilots and then cars with pilots within the range. Remember, however,
that the objects in allObjects variable are not actually retrieved from the
database until they are browsed or used. If you want to get them all into the
memory for future use, utilize ToList or ToArray methods.</p><a name="Join Query"></a><h2>Join Query</h2>

<p>Above we've already discussed how to select objects of one
type based on the selection of the other type. However, that way is rather
cumbersome and most probably you won't need it: you can use join operator
instead:</p>





<p>This simple syntax allows you to join any amount of classes
using any possible relationship between them. You can also make use of <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb308959.aspx">Join</a>
extension method syntax to get the same result.</p><a name="Sorting"></a><h2>Sorting</h2>

<p>Sorting is added with <code>orderby</code> operator and can
be ascending(default) or descending.</p>



<p>We can also use subsequent sorts. For example sort by name
descending and by points ascending:</p>





<p>The same effect can be achieved by using
<code>OrderBy/OrderByDescending</code> and <code>ThenBy/ThenByDescending</code>
extension methods.</p><a name="Grouping Results"></a><h2>Grouping Results</h2>

<p>Grouping results can be often useful in different reports.
For example, we can group the data from the previous example by pilot's name:</p>





<p>Here we use <code>GroupBy</code> extension method. The
parameters specify the grouping property (Points) and the display property
(Name).</p><a name="Modified Result"></a><h2>Modified Result</h2>

<p>Sometimes we need to apply some calculation on each result -
with LINQ we can do that directly in the query:</p>







<p>In the example above the query will bring as the calculated
percentage of maximum for each pilot's points.<br></p>

<a name="Selecting A Result"></a><h2>Selecting A Result</h2>

<p>Though a query usually returns all the candidates matching
the selected criteria, we can specify which of the results we want:
<code>First</code>, <code>ElementAt</code>, <code>Any</code>, <code>All</code>.</p>





<p>The query above will return <code>true</code> if there are
any objects in the result set and <code>false</code> otherwise.</p><a name="Aggregate Functions"></a><h2>Aggregate Functions</h2>

<p>Often we are not interested in each and every result, but
need some statistics about it: sum, aggregate, average, max etc. This can be
achieved with extension methods.</p>





<p>This method returns only the average value of pilot points.</p>





<p>In this case we use <code>Aggregate</code> extension method
to return all the names and a semicolon-separated string. In
<code>Aggregate</code> function first parameter specify the initial return
value, second parameter is a function that appends each new value to the
initial value.</p></div>
