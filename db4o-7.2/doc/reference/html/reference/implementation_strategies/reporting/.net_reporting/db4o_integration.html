        <h1>Db4o Integration</h1><p><font color="#990000">This topic applies to .NET version only</font>&nbsp;</p><p>We will use a separate module to maintain a database
connection and perform db4o operations: <a href="db4o_manager.html" class="wikiLink">Db4o Manager</a>. </p>

<p>The following function will add several Pilot objects to the
database:</p>






<p>Report's data source can accept a single object (Textbox
control) or a list of objects (Table, List, Chart etc.). In this example we use
a table, so a list of objects is needed:</p>






<p>This function will return a list of pilot object IDs.
Please, note, that the actual objects will be instantiated only as they are
being retrieved from the list, which means that db4o connection should be kept
open while the report is being created. </p></div>
