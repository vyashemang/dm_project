        <h1>Persistent Class</h1><p><font color="#990000">This topic applies to .NET version only</font>&nbsp;</p><p>First of all you will need to define an object class, which
will be used for the report. Windows.Reporting uses object attributes as field
values. Let's use the following class for an example:</p>





<p>The Pilot class has Name and Points attributes. These
attributes can be used as report fields. If you need more fields to be present
in your report you can specify additional attributes in your class or create a
custom query class, which can combine information from several objects.</p>

<p>The Pilot class should be built before it will become
accessible for reporting.</p>
