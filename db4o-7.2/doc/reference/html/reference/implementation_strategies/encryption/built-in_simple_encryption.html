        <h1>Built-In Simple Encryption</h1> 

<P>(This functionality is deprecated)</P>
<P>The other encryption methods built-into db4o, is called simple encryption. To use it, the following two methods have to be called, before a database file is created:</P>
<span name="cs_wiki_filter" csw_filters="java">
<P>Java: </P><code> Db4o.configure().encrypt(true); Db4o.configure().password("yourEncryptionPasswordHere"); </code> 
</span>

<P>The security standard of the built-in encryption functionality is not very high, not much more advanced than "substract 5 from every byte". This is great for systems with limited resources, or where the encryption needs to be done as quickly as possible.</P></div>
