        <h1>Exceptions</h1><p>Db4o versions prior to 6.2 were designed to silently
"swallow" most of the exceptions. This mode proved to be efficient in the
situations, when db4o is supposed to work without interruptions under any
circumstances.</p>

<p>However there are many situations when it is vitally
important for the user to know what went wrong and to be able to react
accordingly. Some of the examples:</p>

<ul><li>callbacks;</li><li>opening database file or client connection;</li><li>unsupported schema changes;</li><li>invalid ID format;</li><li>corrupted database file, etc</li></ul>











<p>The new approach introduced in the db4o 6.2 allows
exceptions to "bubble up" to the user level. </p>
