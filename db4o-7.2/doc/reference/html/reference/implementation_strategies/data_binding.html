        <h1>Data Binding</h1><p><font color="#990000">This topic applies to .NET version only</font>  <br></p><p>One common question we get from our users is:</p>
<p><b>Can I still take advantage of data aware control mechanisms with my objects?</b></p>
<p>The answer is quite simply yes. .NET data binding also works with plain 
objects.</p>
<p>This is also to say that using db4o is completely orthogonal to the 
use of data binding.</p>
<p>The usual pattern would be something like the 
following:</p><ul><li>
the code asks db4o to retrieve the objects that must be 
presented to the user</li><li>the UI controls are bound to the objects (no 
interaction with db4o here)</li><li>the user interacts with the objects through 
the controls (no interaction with db4o here)</li><li>when the user is done 
interacting with the objects or by his request, the application will ask db4o to 
persist his changes
</li></ul><p>Let's take a very simple example that illustrates 
the points above.</p>
