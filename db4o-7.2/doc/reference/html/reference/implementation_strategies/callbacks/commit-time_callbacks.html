        <h1>Commit-Time Callbacks</h1><p>Commit-time callbacks were introduced in db4o version 6.2.</p>

<p>Commit-time callbacks allow a user to add some specific
behavior just before and just after a transaction is committed. </p>

<p>Typical use-cases for commit-time callbacks:</p>

<ul><li>add constraint-violation checking before commit;</li><li>check application-specific conditions before commit is done;</li><li>start synchronization or backup after commit;</li><li>notify other clients/applications about
successful/unsuccessful commit.</li></ul>







<p>Commit-time callbacks can be triggered by the following 2 events:<b></b></p><ul><li><b>Committing</b>: event
     subscribers are notified before the container starts any meaningful commit
     work and are allowed to cancel the entire operation by throwing an
     exception; the ObjectContainer instance is completely blocked while
     subscribers are being notified which is both a blessing because
     subscribers can count on a stable and safe environment and a curse because
     it prevents any parallelism with the container;</li><li><b>Committed</b>:
event subscribers are notified in a separate thread after the container has completely
finished the commit operation; exceptions if any will be ignored.

</li></ul>
