        <h1>Exception Types</h1><p>Using db4o you will have to deal with db4o-specific
exceptions and system exceptions thrown
directly out of db4o (like OutOfMemory error in Java or System.Exception in
.NET).</p>

<p>Db4o-specific exceptions are Unchecked exceptions, which all
inherit from a single root class Db4oException.</p>

<span name="cs_wiki_filter" csw_filters="java">

<p>In Java Unchecked exceptions are inherited from
RuntimeExceptions class, while in .NET all exceptions are unchecked.</p>

</span>

<p>Db4o exceptions are chained; you can get the cause of the
exception using:</p>

<span name="cs_wiki_filter" csw_filters="java"><p>Java:&nbsp;</p>

<p><code>db4oException.getCause();</code></p>

</span>





<p>In order to see all db4o-specific exceptions you can examine
the hierarchy of Db4oException class. Currently the following exceptions are
available:</p>

<p><b>Db4oException </b>- db4o
exception wrapper: exceptions occurring during internal processing will be
proliferated to the client calling code encapsulated in an exception of this
type.</p><p><b>BackupInProgressException</b> - an exception to be thrown when another process is already busy with the backup.<br></p>

<p><b>ConstraintViolationException
</b>- base class for all
constraint exceptions.</p>

<p><b>UniqueFieldValueConstraintViolationException</b> - an exception to be used to determine
constraint violation on commit.</p><p><b>DatabaseClosedException</b> - an exception to be thrown when the database was closed or failed to open.&nbsp;</p><p><b>DatabaseFileLockedException</b> - this exception is thrown during any of db4o open calls if the database file is locked by another process.&nbsp;</p><p><b>DatabaseMaximumSizeReachedException</b> - this exception is thrown if the database size is bigger than possible.&nbsp;</p><p><b>DatabaseReadOnlyException</b> - an exception to be thrown when a write operation was attempted on a database in read-only mode.</p><b>GlobalOnlyConfigException</b> - this exception is thrown when a global-only configuration setting is attempted for the local configuration.&nbsp;<p><b>IncompatibleFileFormatException</b> - an exception to be thrown when an open operation is attempted on a file(database), which format is incompatible with the current version of db4o.</p><p><b>InvalidIDException</b> - an exception to be thrown when an ID format supplied to #bind or #getById methods is incorrect.&nbsp;</p><p><b>InvalidPasswordException</b> - this exception is thrown when the password provided to access an encrypted database is not correct.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>OldFormatException</b> - an exception to be thrown when an old file
format was detected and the file could not be open.</p><p><b>ReflectException</b> - an exception to be thrown when a class can not be stored or instantiated by current db4o reflector.<br></p>

<p><b>ReplicationConflictException</b> - an exception to be thrown when a conflict
occurs and no ReplicationEventListener is specified.</p></div>
