<p>In Java version TVector and THashtable classes represent collection translators. Internally they are used to store&nbsp; Vector and Hashtable classes accordingly.<br></p>
</span>
<p>The functionality of these translators is pretty
straightforward:</p>

<ul>
<li>OnStore
     the members of the object are moved to an object array (Entry array for
     TDictionary and THashtable).</li>
<li>OnActivate
     a new collection object is constructed from the array values.</li>
</ul>

In general you will never need to use any of these
translators as all the work is done for you under the hood. However you might
be interested to have a look at their code if you are planning a totally new
custom collection implementation (not CollectionBase derived). The source code
for collection translators can be found in Db4objects.Db4o.Config namespace/com.db4o.config package.
