        <h1>Client-Server Timeouts</h1>Every client/server application has to face a problem of
network communications. Luckily modern protocols screen the end-application
from all fixable problems; however there are still physical reasons that can't
be fixed by a protocol: disconnections, power failures, crash of a system on
the other end of communication channel etc. In these cases it is still the
responsibility of the client-server application to exit the connection
gracefully, releasing all resources and protecting data. 

<p>In order to achieve an efficient client/server communication
and handling of connection problems the following requirements were defined for
db4o:</p>

<ul><li>The connection should not
     be terminated when both client and server are still alive, even if either
     of the machines is running under heavy load. </li><li>Whenever a client dies,
     peacefully or with a crash, the server should clean up all resources that
     were reserved for the client. </li><li>Whenever a server goes
     offline, it should be possible for the client to detect that there is a problem.
     </li><li>Since many clients may be
     connected at the same time, it makes sense to be careful with the
     resources the server reserves for each client. </li><li>A client can be a very
     small machine, so it would be good if the client application can work with
     a single thread.</li></ul>

<p>Unfortunately all the requirements are difficult to achieve
for a cross-platform application, as Java and .NET sockets behave differently.</p>

<p>The initial db4o CS implementation used one-thread clients
and connection was terminated when there was a timeout and a post-timeout check-up
message could not get a response from the other side. However this approach
failed for .NET implementation, as .NET sockets upon timeout continue to send
and receive messages, but timeout settings are not respected anymore, which in
fact leads to a very high CPU usage.</p>

<p>The next approach was to create a separate housekeeping thread
on the server, which will send messages to the client regularly, thus checking
if the client is still alive and in the same time giving the client information
about the server. Unfortunately, the problem described above can occur to the
housekeeping thread too.</p>

<p>The current approach tries to keep things as simple as
possible: any connection is closed immediately upon a timeout. In order to
prevent closing connections when there is no communication between client and
server due to reasons different from connection problems a separate timer
thread was created to send messages to the server at a regular basis. The
server must reply to the thread immediately, if this does not happen the
communication channel gets closed. </p>

<p>This approach works effectively for both client and server side, however
there are two small downsides:</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clients
are not single-threaded anymore</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If
an action on the server takes longer than the socket timeout, the connection
will be closed. </p>

<p>In the latter case you can adjust the behaviour of db4o with the following
configuration settings:</p>

<span name="cs_wiki_filter" csw_filters="java"><p>Java:&nbsp;</p>

<p><code>configuration.clientServer().timeoutServerSocket(int
milliseconds)</code></p>

<p><code>configuration.clientServer().timeoutClientSocket(int
milliseconds)</code></p>

</span>



<p>An easy rule of thumb:<br></p><ul><li>
If you experience clients disconnecting, raise the timeout value.</li><li>
If you have a system where clients crash frequently or where the network is
very instable, lower the values, so resources for disconnected clients are
freed faster.</li></ul></div>
