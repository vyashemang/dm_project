        <h1>Object Manager Sources</h1><p><a href="http://developer.db4o.com/Resources/view.aspx/Reference/Object_Manager_For_Db4o">Object
Manager</a> is a GUI tool for browsing, querying and managing db4o
database.&nbsp; Object Manager sources are
available from the following projects in our <a href="https://source.db4o.com/db4o/trunk">SVN</a>:</p>

<ul><li>objectmanager-swing
     - contains Object Manager GUI application</li><li>objectmanager-api
     - contains Object Manager API </li></ul>



<p>Object Manager application depends on db4o Java library. In
order to build Object Manager you will need to check out and build db4o java
distribution. Note, that Object Manager sources and db4o sources should be checked out in the same folder.</p><p>You can build Object Manager by running build.xml in objectmanager-swing folder. The ready distribution package will appear in the same folder on completion.&nbsp;</p></div>
