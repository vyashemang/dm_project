This solution is elegant and straightforward as no mixture of concepts (object and relational) occurs. However, the challenge is to make this solution performant.<br></p><p>If the NQ code is run as is, it requires instantiation of
all the members of a class. This is very slow in most cases. In order to
improve the performance a special optimizer is used by db4o. The idea of the
optimization is to analyze the code in a Native Query and provide an
alternative in a database query language. This can be done in runtime or build
time.</p><p>For detailed information about optimization strategies, please, see <a href="../native_query_optimization.html" class="wikiLink">Native Query Optimization</a>.<br></p><a name="Alternate Strategies&nbsp;"></a><h2>Alternate Strategies&nbsp;</h2><p>Obviously, optimization is not possible in cases, when a
native query does not have a database query alternative. To reveal those cases

should be used.</p>
