<P><FONT color=#990000>This topic applies to Java version only</FONT></P>
<P>Java Security Manager can be used to specify Java application security permissions. It is usually provided by web-browsers for applet execution, however any Java application can make use of a security manager. For example, to use the default security manager you will only need to pass <code>-Djava.security.manager</code> option to JVM command line. Custom security managers can be created and utilized as well (please refer to Java documentation for more information).</P>
<P>Unfortunately, current db4o implementation can't work under a default security manager. If this feature is important for you, please, vote and watch db4o task <A href="http://tracker.db4o.com/browse/COR-830">COR-830</A>.</P></div>
