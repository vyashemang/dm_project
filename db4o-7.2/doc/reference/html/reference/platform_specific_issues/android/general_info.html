application process, removing the overhead associated with a client-server
configuration, although db4o can also be used in client-server mode. Both db4o
and SQLite offer zero-configuration run modes, which allows to get the database
up and running immediately.</p>

<a name="Access Control"></a><h3>Access Control</h3>

<p>SQLite relies solely on the file system for its database permissions and has
no concept of user accounts. SQLite has database-level locks and does not
support client/server mode.</p>

<p>db4o can use encryption or client/server mode for user access control.
Client/server can also be used in embedded mode, i.e on the same device.</p>

<a name="Referential Integrity"></a><h3>Referential Integrity</h3>

<p>Traditionally referential integrity in relational databases is implemented
with the help of foreign keys. However SQLite <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/omitted.html">does not support</a> this feature. In
db4o referential integrity is imposed by the object model, i.e. you can't
reference an object that does not exist. </p>

<a name="Transactions"></a><h3>Transactions</h3>

<p>Both db4o and SQLite support ACID transactions. </p><p>In db4o all the work is
transactional: transaction is implicitly started when the database is open and
closed either by explicit commit() call or by close() call through implicit
commit.&nbsp; Data is protected from system crash during all application lifecycle. If a crash occurs during commit itself, the commit will be restarted when the system is up again if the system had enough time to write the list of changes, otherwise the transaction will be rolled back to the last safe state.<br></p><p>In SQLite autocommit feature is
used by default: transaction is started when a SQL command other than SELECT is
executed and commit is executed as soon as pending operation is finished. Explicit
BEGIN and END TRANSACTION(COMMIT) or ROLLBACK can be used alternatively to
specify user-defined transaction limits. Database crash always results in
pending transaction rollback. Nested transactions are not supported.</p><a name="Database Size"></a><h3>Database Size</h3>

<p>Though embeddable db4o and SQLite support big database files:</p>

<ul><li>db4o up to 256 GB</li><li> 
SQLite up to 2TB</li></ul>



<p>all the data is stored in a single database file. db4o also supports clustered databases.<br></p>
