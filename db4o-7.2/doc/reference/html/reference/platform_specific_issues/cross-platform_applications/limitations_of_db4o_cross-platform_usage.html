        <h1>Limitations Of Db4o Cross-Platform Usage</h1><p><br></p><p>db4o cross-platform functionality is work in progress.
Currently, it provides the basic features that enable you to use Java database
on .NET and vice versa. However, it is recommended to familiarize yourself with
the current limitations:</p>

<p>1. Some objects are treated differently in Java and .NET and
could not be translated cleanly. This includes:</p>

<ul><li>Enumerations. In Java enumerations are similar to classes
whereas in .NET enumeration is just a primitive type. For more information on
how db4o treats both types see <a href="../../implementation_strategies/type_handling/static_fields_and_enums.html" class="wikiLink">Static Fields And Enums</a></li><li>Final Fields in Java behave differently in different
platforms, which does not correspond to .NET readonly or const members. See
<a href="../../implementation_strategies/type_handling/final_fields.html" class="wikiLink">Final Fields</a></li><li>Collections. Please, keep an eye on <a href="http://tracker.db4o.com/browse/COR-766">COR-766</a> Jira issue to see
when collections cross-platfrom handling will be fixed.</li></ul>





<p>2. Cross-platform client/server usage (Java server, .NET
client or vice versa) is currently out of order (<a href="http://tracker.db4o.com/browse/COR-765">COR-765</a>).</p><p>In general using db4o in cross-platform environment, you
must try to keep your persistent class definitions simple and unambiguously
interpreted on both platforms. Avoid constructs that exist only on Java or only
on .NET platform.</p>

Please, keep an eye on db4o <a href="http://tracker.db4o.com/">Jira</a> and <a href="http://developer.db4o.com/blogs">news</a> to stay informed about the
latest progress on db4o cross-platform functionality.
