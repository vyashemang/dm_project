<p>db4o_osgi project (since db4o-6.3) provides a service, which
allows to use db4o in OSGI environment. Its usage is the usage of an OSGI
service, which is well documented in the Internet. Short and essential guide to
OSGI service usage can be found <a href="http://www.knopflerfish.org/osgi_service_tutorial.html">here</a>, but you
are surely free to use any suitable for you technique to access db4o_osgi
service.</p>



<p>The main purpose of db4o_osgi service is to configure an
OSGi bundle aware reflector for the database instance, so that classes that are
owned by the client bundle are accessible to the db4o engine. To emulate this
behavior when using db4o directly through the exported packages of the
db4o_osgi plugin, db4o can be configured like this:</p>

<p><code>Configuration config = Db4o.newConfiguration();</code></p>

<p><code>config.reflectWith(new
JdkReflector(SomeData.class.getClassLoader()));</code></p>

<p><code>// ... </code></p>

<p><code>ObjectContainer database =
Db4o.openFile(config,fileName); </code></p>

<p>&nbsp;Access through the service is recommended
over the direct usage, though, as the service may implement further OSGi
specific features in the future.</p>



<p>db4o_osgi.jar can be found in /lib folder of the Java
distribution with detailed API documentation in /doc/osgi folder.</p>

<p>If you are comfortable with OSGI and only need a short
introduction to db4o_osgi service you can read <a href="database_for_osgi/db4o-osgi_usage.html" class="wikiLink">Db4o-Osgi Usage</a>.</p>

<p>For a more detailed explanation and example of db4o-service
usage in an Eclipse plug-in see <a href="database_for_osgi/eclipse_plug-in_with_db4o_service.html" class="wikiLink">Eclipse Plug-In With Db4o Service</a>. This
example will be also helpful for those who are new to OSGI.</p>
