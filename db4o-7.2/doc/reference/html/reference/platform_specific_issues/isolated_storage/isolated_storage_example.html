        <h1>Isolated Storage Example</h1>
<p><font color="#990000">This topic applies to .NET version only</font></p>
<p>In order to use our special
<a href="isolatedstoragefileadapter.html" class="wikiLink">IsolatedStorageFileAdapter</a> the following configuration method should be
called. </p>





<p>In this example we will use
<a href="../../tuning/debugging_db4o.html" class="wikiLink">debug message level</a> = 1 to see what is
happening in the console.</p>

<p>Let's try to save some objects and retrieve them. Remember,
that the path in the Isolated Storage is not the path on the file system. For
simplicity you can specify the database file with only the file name. For more
information about creating directory structure in the Isolated Storage, please
refer to the appropriate documentation. </p>

<p>Run the following examples and check the output in the
console to see how the <code>IsolatedStorageFileAdapter</code> works:</p>





<p>There is one more thing to remember: delete file operation
does not belong to db4o API, so if we need to delete the database from within
the application we will need to use Isolated Storage functions:</p>
