        <h1>Atomicity</h1>

<p>Atomicity
states the mode, in which either all or no modifications are written to the
database. In this mode each transaction is said to be "atomic". If any part of
the transaction fails, the whole transaction will fail too. For example, in a
bank transfer transaction there are 2 parts: debit and credit. If the debit
operation was successful, but the credit failed, the whole transaction should
fail and the system should remain in the initial state. </p>

<p>Some of
the atomicity features:</p>
