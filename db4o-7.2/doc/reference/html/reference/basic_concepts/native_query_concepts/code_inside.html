        <h1>Code Inside</h1>

<p>Native Query expression is dealt as a normal peace of code.
Therefore, any language construction is legible inside:</p>

<ul><li>variables;</li><li>temporary
     objects created within a query;</li><li>static
     calls;</li><li>exception
     handling.</li></ul><p>However, some restrictions do apply:</p>

<ul><li>NQ
     should not be used to modify the database to prevent loops;</li><li>NQ
     should not use threads, as NQ are expected to be triggered in large
     numbers;</li><li>NQ
     should be fast, therefore they should not interact with the GUI;</li><li>NQ
     should follow security restrictions, as they are executed in the server
     and potentially can create malicious behavior there.</li></ul>

<p>In a case of uncaught exception within a Native Query a null
result is returned.</p>
