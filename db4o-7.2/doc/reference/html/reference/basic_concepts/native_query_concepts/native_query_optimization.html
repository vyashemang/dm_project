        <h1>Native Query Optimization</h1>

<p>Though Native Query API discussed in the
<a href="native_query_implementation.html" class="wikiLink">previous paragraph</a> is simple and
straightforward, the real challenge is to provide a performant solution.</p>

<p>If the NQ code is run as is, it requires instantiation of
all the members of a class. This is very slow in most cases. In order to
improve the performance a special optimizer is used by db4o. The idea of the
optimization is to analyze the code in a Native Query and provide an
alternative in a database query language. This can be done in runtime or build
time.</p>

<p>Obviously, optimization is not possible in cases, when a
native query does not have a database query alternative. To reveal those cases
<a href="../../tuning/diagnostics/nativequerynotoptimized.html" class="wikiLink">db4o Diagnostic</a> system
should be used.</p>
