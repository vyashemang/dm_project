        <h1>Encapsulation</h1>

<p>Encapsulation is an object model concept, which allows to
hide specific behavior or processing abilities within object instances defined
by a class. Method definitions within a class are an integral part of
encapsulation, which allows to store data and code together. </p><p>

For example:</p><p><img src="Encaps.Jpg"/><br>

</p><p>getPilot method can be "attached to" a Car object or
encapsulated. Alternatively, getPilot method can be stored in the application
or a separate library and distributed with the object database. However,
encapsulation approach has an important advantage: method code cannot be lost
or outdated as in the case of an application/library storage. Object system
recognizes which methods belong to which data. The process of the correct
method linking to the object is called <i><b>dispatching</b></i>.</p>
