        <h1>Inheritance</h1>

<p>Inheritance is a way to form new classes based on the
classes that have already been defined. </p><p>

For example:</p><p><img src="Inherit.Jpg"/><br>

</p><p>The derived class inherits all the fields and methods of the
base class. Note that in the object model, there is no distinction between
using system and user-defined types, so you can define sub-types of the system
types. This feature is known as extensibility.</p>

In the example above <code>getSignature</code> method
is overridden in the derived class - this is known as <b><i>polymorphism</i>. </b>The
ability of the object model to execute the correct method based on the type of
a class is called <b><i>dispatching</i>.</b><br></div>
