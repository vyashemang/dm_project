        <h1>Referential Integrity</h1>

<p>Referential integrity (RI) is an important feature of RDBMS.
It helps to protect data from misuse and corruption.&nbsp; However, in the modern world of multi-tier and distributed technologies
it becomes questionable if referential integrity should be realized on a
database level or is it a responsibility of a business layer. The answer to
this question depends on the system design.&nbsp;
Usually database RI makes lots of sense in a data-centric application
with one main database. More complex, distributed in space and time referential
constraints can be better implemented within a business object framework.</p>

db4o database does not provide full referential
integrity support, rather it gives a user possibilities to implement RI on the
application level. For an example of a referential integrity solution, see
