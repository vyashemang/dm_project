        <h1>Indexes</h1>

<p>Indexes play an important role in database performance
optimization. An index is a special data structure that helps to make searches
more effective. In db4o, as in many relational databases, indexes are based on
B-Trees. You can define an index for any object field (including private ones).
</p>

<p>Several indexes on different fields of the same class will
result in better searching performance. Unlike relational databases db4o does
not allow indexes over a set of fields. For more information see <a href="../../../tuning/indexing.html" class="wikiLink">Indexing</a>
and <a href="../../../tuning/performance_hints/enable_field_indexes.html" class="wikiLink">Enable Field Indexes</a>.</p></div>
