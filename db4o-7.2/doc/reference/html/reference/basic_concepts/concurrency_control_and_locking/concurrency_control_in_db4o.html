        <h1>Concurrency Control In Db4o</h1>

<p>Db4o
uses overly optimistic concurrency control: an object is locked for read and
write, but no collision detection is used. In the same time, db4o provides you
with all means to implement a suitable for you concurrency control strategy in
your application. For more information see <a href="../../client-server/concurrency_control.html" class="wikiLink">Concurrency Control</a>.</p></div>
