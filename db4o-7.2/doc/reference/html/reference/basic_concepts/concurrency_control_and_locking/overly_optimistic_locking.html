        <h1>Overly Optimistic Locking</h1><p>Overly Optimistic Locking is a strategy, which
assumes that the collision will never occur, therefore the system does not try
to prevent a collision or to detect it. It is important to understand that this
system can be only used in a single-user mode. Multi-user mode will require
additional concurrency control strategy to be applied.
