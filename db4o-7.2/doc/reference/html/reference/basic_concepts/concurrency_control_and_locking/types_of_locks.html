        <h1>Types Of Locks</h1><p>Locking can also be classified by
the entities that are being locked. Usually the following types are
distinguished:</p>

<ul class="unIndentedList"><li>
Page locking: all the data on a specific memory page is
locked.</li><li>
Cluster locking: all the objects in a cluster are
locked (applies only to cluster-enabled object databases).</li><li>
Class or table locking: all objects of a class (OODBMS)
or all rows in a table (RDBMS) will be locked.</li><li>Object or instance locking: a single object (OODBMS)
or a single relational tuple (RDBMS) will be locked.

</li></ul></div>
